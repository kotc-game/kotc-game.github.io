        <p>Trading card games are a lot of fun. Being able to customize your deck based on what kind of strategy you prefer and what kind of style you like is something that appeals to many, and trading card games are a fantastic outlet for that. But what if you want to go beyond that?</p>
        <p>Keeper of the Cards goes beyond by allowing you to not only construct your deck, but also design your own cards. Here's how: instead of being designed around a set of specific card pools, Keeper of the Cards is designed around a set of specific card <em>text components</em>, along with specific formulas for how to calculate the stats of a card.</p>
        <p>Gameplay-wise, Keeper of the Cards takes most of its gameplay inspiration from <cite>Duel Masters</cite>, with some slight influences from other games as well. The rules are meant to be as simple as possible to ease onboarding, but also to add a unique flair.</p>
        <p>Interested? Download the <a href="play.html">Starter Set</a> to get started! You can review the <a href="rulebook.html">Rulebook</a> for how to play the game, and the <a href="cardbuilding.html">Card Building Guide</a> for how to create your own cards.</p>
