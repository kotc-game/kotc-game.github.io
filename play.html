        <p>To play Keeper of the Cards, you'll need to print some cards. You'll also want a rulebook so that you can learn the rules, and in case you want to design your own cards (that's the whole point of the game, after all!), you'll want to know how to do that. To facilitate this, a starter set is available with all of these things, plus some helpful scripts and "tip cards" to hand out to friends so you can introduce the game to others! The latest starter set can be found here:</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/kotc-game/kotc/releases">https://github.com/kotc-game/kotc/releases</a></p>
        <p>Here is a quick run-down of what you will find in the starter set:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The top level folder contains the rulebook, card building guide, and a template for creating cards.</li>
            <li>The "card_base" folder contains the basic card face and back images. The card back image is provided as a GIMP XCF file and an image that can be provided to card printing services (such as <a href="https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/custom-blank-card.html#">BoardGamesMaker.com</a>).</li>
            <li>The "cards" folder contains several example cards as GIMP XCF files. The "cards-png" folder contains these same example cards as images that can be provided to card printing services (such as <a href="https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/custom-blank-card.html#">BoardGamesMaker.com</a>) for printing.</li>
            <li>The "tip_cards" folder contains a collection of "tip cards" as GIMP XCF files, while the "tip_cards-png" folder contains the same tip cards as images that can be provided to card printing services (such as <a href="https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/custom-blank-card.html#">BoardGamesMaker.com</a>). These are cards you can give to friends you're teaching the game to; they pack all the most essential information into a convenient form, and they have a link to the Keeper of the Cards website too, so you can make it easy for your friends to get started printing their own cards.</li>
            <li>The "sets" folder contains LibreOffice Draw (.odg) files which lay out all example cards and all tip cards conveniently onto U.S. Letter-sized pages, perfect for printing. It also contains a set of card backs ("backs.odg"), so you can simply flip the pages over and print that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also <a href="discuss.html">discuss the game on IRC</a>!</p>
